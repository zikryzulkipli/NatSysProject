## Rules
1. You are allowed to have **3 group** members.
2. When you complete the assignment, make sure to submit the repository link of your cloned project. Make sure all the files are as what you aspect in your repository. 
3. Answer all questions in the **README.md**, in your own repository. Either use the online VSCode, terminal or github to edit. Answers are expected where you see __Fill answer here__.
4. Learn how to use markdown. https://www.w3schools.io/file/markdown-introduction/

## Forking this project repository
1. First thing you need in doing this assignment is to have a github account. Make sure to sign up at https://www.github.com
2. The second thing you need is to fork the Net&Sys Assignment repository in your own github account. 

    1. Go to https://github.com/ZainabBashi/NatSysProject and click fork to copy the project into your own repository
    2. Make sure that the new fork is now in your own repository

***Questions:***

1. What is the link of the fork Net&Sys Assignment in your repository. ***(1 mark)*** 
    - __https://github.com/zikryzulkipli/NatSysProject.git__.
2. How many files and folders are in this repository. ***(1 mark)*** 
    - __2. images, and README.md__.


## Exploring github codespaces

1. The next thing that we will be doing is exploring codespaces. First of all, read about codespaces https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/overview#what-is-a-codespace
2. Then go to the link https://github.com/codespaces and we shall start a new codespace.  
3. Click on ***New codespace***.
4. Choose your own Net&Sys Assignment repository to start your codespace.

5. Once you have created you codespace, you will see the following. You might already be familiar with this, since it will look similar to VSCode. 

 <img src="./images/UIwebvscode.png" width="70%">

6. You will see the [README file](./README.md) file. One is a preview of how it looks like on the web, and the other is the editing view in markdown language. 
7. Edit the [README file](./README.md). Make sure you have your group details correct, ie, group name and team members along with their matric Numbers. 
8. Once you have finish editing, click File->Save or ***ctrl-s*** to save it. 
9. After saving, you will notice an M or U next to your file. You will need to commit any changes, whenever you make changes so that it is uploaded to the github repository. 

 <img src="./images/SourceControlUI.png" width="70%">

10. Click on the source control, hint: its on the left side panel, and it will list down the files that have been modified or updated. Click on commit. It will then ask you "Would you like to stage all your changes and commit them directly?" Just say yes, and a new tab will appear. Type a message to log what you have done, and click on the check mark. 

 <img src="./images/CommittingUI.png" width="70%">

11. After that, sync the changes to the main repository. 
12. Make sure to commit and sync your files to the main repository, or else, your work will be lost since it is not saved into the main repository when you submit your project.

***Questions:***

1. What is default OS used to run the virtual environment for codespaces. ***(1 mark)*** 
    - __Glorious Zebra__.
2. What are the two options of RAM, disk and vcpu configuration you can have in running codespaces . ***(1 mark)*** 
    1. __2-core with 8GB RAM, and 32GB storage__.
    2. __4-core with 16GB RAM, and 32GB storage__.
3. Why must we commit and sync our current work on source control? ***(1 mark)*** 
    - __Committing our work is to publish our work to the team while syncing is to ensure we get the latest commit by the team__.

## Exploring the Terminal

1. Look at the TERMINAL tab. Explore and run commands according to the questions below. 
2. You can include your answers as images, or cut and paste the output here. If you are cutting and pasting your answers, wrap your answers in the codeblock clause in markdown. For example, if i run the command **whoami** the the output would look like the one below.
```bash
@joeynor âžœ /workspaces/OSProject (main) $ whoami 
codespace
```

## Running your own container instance.

1. At the terminal, run a linux instance. By typing the following command. 
```
docker pull debian
docker run --detach -it debian
```
2. This will run the debian container. To check if the debian container is running, type
```bash
@joeynor âžœ /workspaces/OSProject (main) $ docker ps -a
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE     COMMAND   CREATED         STATUS         PORTS     NAMES
f65be1987f84   debian    "bash"    4 minutes ago   Up 4 minutes             romantic_jackson
```

3. Keep note of the name used by your container, this is usually given random names unless you specify your own name. Now run a bash command on the container. Make sure you use the name of your container instead of the one shown here. 
```bash
docker exec -i -t romantic_jackson /bin/bash
```

4. Create a file on the container. First you must make sure you are in the bash command prompt of the container. The container is new, and does not have any software other than the debian OS. To create a new file, you will need an editor installed. In the bash shell of the container, run the package manager apt-get to install nano text editor. 

```bash
root@f65be1987f84:~# apt-get update      

root@f65be1987f84:~# apt-get install nano

root@f65be1987f84:~# cd /root

root@f65be1987f84:~# nano helloworld.txt
```

5. Edit your helloworld.txt, create your messsage and save by typing ctrl-X. Once saved, explore using the container to see where the file is located. Then exit the shell, by typing **exit**.

6. Stop the container and run **docker ps -a**, and restart the container again. Is your file in the container still available?
```bash 
@joeynor âžœ /workspaces/OSProject (main) $ docker stop romantic_jackson

@joeynor âžœ /workspaces/OSProject (main) $ docker ps -a
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE     COMMAND   CREATED          STATUS                        PORTS     NAMES
f65be1987f84   debian    "bash"    19 minutes ago   Exited (137) 18 seconds ago             romantic_jackson

@joeynor âžœ /workspaces/OSProject (main) $ docker restart romantic_jackson
```

7. Stop the container and delete the container. What happened to your helloworld.txt?

```bash 
@joeynor âžœ /workspaces/OSProject (main) $ docker stop romantic_jackson

@joeynor âžœ /workspaces/OSProject (main) $ docker ps -a
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE     COMMAND   CREATED          STATUS                        PORTS     NAMES
f65be1987f84   debian    "bash"    19 minutes ago   Exited (137) 18 seconds ago             romantic_jackson

@joeynor âžœ /workspaces/OSProject (main) $ docker rm romantic_jackson
```

***Questions:***

1. Are files in the container persistent. Why not?. ***(1 mark)*** 
    - __Not persistent. The files lost when the container is removed or stopped.__
2. Can we run two, or three instances of debian linux? . ***(1 mark)*** __Yes.__

## Running your own container with persistent storage

1. In the previous experiment, you might have notice that containers are not persistent. To make storage persistent, you will need to mount them. 
At the terminal, create a new directory called **myroot**, and run a instance of debian linux and mount myroot to the container. Find out the exact path of my root, and mount it as the root folder in the debian container. 
2. Create a file in /root on the container, the files should also appear in myroot of your host VM.

```bash 
@joeynor âžœ /workspaces/OSProject (main) $ mkdir myroot
@joeynor âžœ /workspaces/OSProject (main) $ cd myroot/
@joeynor âžœ /workspaces/OSProject/myroot (main) $ pwd
/workspaces/OSProject/myroot

@joeynor âžœ /workspaces/OSProject/myroot (main) $ docker run --detach -it -v /workspaces/OSProject/myroot:/root debian
```

***Questions:***

1. Check the permission of the files created in myroot, what user and group is the files created in docker container on the host virtual machine? . ***(2 mark)***
```bash
-rw-rw-rw- 1 root root 25 Jun 19 13:21 helloworld.txt
```
2. Can you change the permission of the files to user codespace.  You will need this to be able to commit and get points for this question. ***(2 mark)***
```bash
//use sudo and chown
sudo chown -R codespace:codespace myroot

```
*** __Yes you can change.__***
```bash
-rw-rw-rw- 1 codespace codespace 25 Jun 19 13:21 helloworld.txt
```

## You are on your own, create your own static webpage

1. Create a directory called webpage in your host machine
```bash
@iryanazhar âžœ /workspaces/NatSysProject (main) $ mkdir webpage
@iryanazhar âžœ /workspaces/NatSysProject (main) $ cd webpage
```
2.Inside the directory, create a page index.html, with any content you would like
```bash
@iryanazhar âžœ /workspaces/NatSysProject/webpage (main) $ touch index.html
@iryanazhar âžœ /workspaces/NatSysProject/webpage (main) $ nano index.html
```
3. Then, run the apache webserver and mount the webpage directory to it. Hint:
![image](https://github.com/zikryzulkipli/NatSysProject/assets/170236719/28ed63cd-47b8-445c-8102-697e2b6c808a)


4. If it works, codespace will trigger a port assignment and provide a URL for you to access your webpage like the one below.

 <img src="./images/websitelink.png" width="70%">


5. You can also see the Port in the **PORTS** tab, next to the terminal tab.

6. You can then access your website by adding an index.html towards the end of your url link, like the one below. 

 <img src="./images/helloworldweb.png" width="70%">

***Questions:***

1. What is the permission of folder /usr/local/apache/htdocs and what user and group owns the folder? . ***(2 mark)***
Permissions of Folder /usr/local/apache2/htdocs:

Permissions: drwxr-xr-x

User and Group: User: root Group: root.

2. What port is the apache web server running. ***(1 mark)*** 80
3. What port is open for http protocol on the host machine? ***(1 mark)*** 8080

## Create SUB Networks

1. In docker, you can create your own private networks where you can run multiple services, in this part, we will create two networks, one called bluenet and the other is rednet
2. Run the docker create network to create you networks like the ones below
```bash
## STEP 1:
## Create Networks ##
@wapekkkkk âžœ /workspaces/NatSysProject (main) $ docker network create bluenet
e292bf1aa7188b11ed290b4f7b43492639c704092bca91ef0720f7e3a061f031
@wapekkkkk âžœ /workspaces/NatSysProject (main) $ docker network create rednet
ded73fff84dd60ea16d18901429fa314cb0b5f1fc6d83be370c20fe48f43dce7

## STEP 2: (automatically running)
## Create (1) Container in background called "c1" running busybox image ##
@wapekkkkk âžœ /workspaces/NatSysProject (main) $ docker run -itd --net bluenet --name c1 busybox sh
Unable to find image 'busybox:latest' locally

```
***Questions:***

1. Describe what is busybox and what is command switch **--name** is for? . ***(2 mark)*** BusyBox: BusyBox is a software suite that provides several Unix utilities in a single executable file. It is often used in embedded systems and Docker containers because it offers a lightweight set of tools that are efficient and functional. --name switch: The --name switch in Docker is used to assign a name to a container. This makes it easier to reference the container by name rather than by its container ID, simplifying management and identification of the container
2. Explore the network using the command ```docker network ls```, show the output of your terminal. ***(1 mark)***

3. Using ```docker inspect c1``` and ```docker inspect c2``` inscpect the two network. What is the gateway of bluenet and rednet.? ***(1 mark)***
   Gateway bluenet :172.18.0.1
   Gateway rednet : 172.19.0.1
5. What is the network address for the running container c1 and c2.
   Ip address c1 :172.18.0.2
   Ip address c2 :172.19.0.2
7. Using the command ```docker exec c1 ping c2```, which basically issue a ping from container c1 to c2. Are you able to ping? Show your output . ***(1 mark)***

No , Since c1 and c2 are on different networks (bluenet and rednet respectively), they cannot communicate directly with each other. Therefore, the ping command fails with a "bad address" error.

## Bridging two SUB Networks
1. Let's try this again by creating a network to bridge the two containers in the two subnetworks
```
@wapekkkkk âžœ /workspaces/NatSysProject (main) $ docker network create bridgenet
f720d32a9f27c2817ebbe5ee6005f48a0426af7bb43a2903ef6f1627e1c71d04
@wapekkkkk âžœ /workspaces/NatSysProject (main) $ docker network connect bridgenet c1
@wapekkkkk âžœ /workspaces/NatSysProject (main) $ docker network connect bridgenet c2
@wapekkkkk âžœ /workspaces/NatSysProject (main) $ docker exec c1 ping c2
```

Yes . I am able to ping c2 from c1 successfully.
Previous Ping: The previous ping attempt failed with the error ping: bad address 'c2' because c1 and c2 were on separate, isolated networks (bluenet and rednet) and couldn't communicate with each other directly.

Current Ping: After connecting both containers to the bridgenet network, they are now part of a common network, allowing them to communicate with each other. As a result, the ping from c1 to c2 is successful.
